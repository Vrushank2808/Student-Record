# Student Record Management using LocalStorage

This project is a simple web application that allows users to manage student records using **LocalStorage** in the browser. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can add, search, and manage records such as student names and details, all stored locally in the browser. 

## Features

- **Add Records**: Enter the student's name and details to create a new record.
- **Search Records**: Search for existing records by name.
- **Date Logging**: Each record logs the date when it was added.
- **LocalStorage Support**: All records are stored locally in the browser using LocalStorage, so data persists even after refreshing the page.
- **Delete Records**: Remove records with the click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is simple and adjusts for different screen sizes.

## Getting Started

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the application.

   Alternatively, you can run a local server to serve the project using Python or any other server of your choice.
